# NYC_VehicleCrash_Analysis
This project involves the analysis of NYC Vehicle crash data and builds a tool to perform the prediction of future (up to 6 days) crash and resulting injuries nd fatalities for a specific zip code of the NYC.

The tool is built on "Streamlit" platform. The "DataScience_task.ipynb" file is used to build the models. The built models are then deployed into the "project_main.py" file.

To run this project make sure of the following items -
1. Have all the required libraries given in the "project_main.py" and "DataScience_task.ipynb" file.
2. Use Stream run "project_main.py" command in terminal to execute the project.
